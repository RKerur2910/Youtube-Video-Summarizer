# Youtube-Video-Summarizer

This project is a Streamlit web application that summarizes the content of any public YouTube video using large language models. It extracts the transcript from the video and generates a concise summary using Googleâ€™s Gemini 1.5 Pro model. If captions are not available, the application transcribes the video using Whisper, ensuring it can handle nearly any video input.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to automate the process of understanding long-form video content by generating accurate, structured summaries from YouTube videos. It combines video processing, transcription, and language modeling into an end-to-end summarization tool.
